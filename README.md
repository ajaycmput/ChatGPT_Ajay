# ChatGPT_Ajay

I created a version of a chat GPT.

I used OpenAI's API to train this version of the model and implemented it into a chatbot. Hoping to continue improving and expanding on this project,

and I'm grateful for the resources and tools that OpenAI has provided to make it possible.

The sever is being run and deployed on **render** web service and the client is run and deployed through **vercel**
